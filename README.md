### Usage Instructions

1. **Install Aztec CLI** - Installs the Aztec CLI and dependencies
2. **Configure Node Settings** - Set up your node with Ethereum RPC URLs, validator key, etc.
3. **Start Sequencer Node** - Run your node (preferably in a screen or tmux session)
4. **Register as Validator** - Register your node as a validator on the network
5. **View Configuration** - View your current settings (private key is masked)
6. **Fix Common Issues** - Tools to solve common problems

## üìä Configuration

The script will create a configuration file at `~/.aztec-config.json` with the following settings:

- `ethereumHosts`: Your Ethereum RPC URL(s)
- `l1ConsensusHostUrls`: L1 Consensus Host URL(s)
- `validatorPrivateKey`: Your validator private key
- `coinbase`: Your coinbase address
- `p2pIp`: Your public IP address for P2P communication
- `network`: The Aztec network to use (default: alpha-testnet)
- `stakingAssetHandler`: Contract address for staking
- `l1ChainId`: L1 chain ID (default: Sepolia 11155111)

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Run the node in a persistent session**:
   ```bash
   screen -S aztec-node
   ```
   
   To detach from the screen: Press `Ctrl+A` followed by `D`
   To reattach to the screen: `screen -r aztec-node`

2. **Secure your machine**:
   - Keep your OS updated
   - Use strong SSH passwords or (preferably) key-based authentication
   - Consider setting up a firewall

3. **Check port forwarding**:
   - Make sure port 40400 is forwarded if you're running behind a router
